# Detailed Report: Implementation of Scaffold System for Prompt Scribe

## Files Modified During Implementation

- `src/promptscribe/cli.py` - Updated init command to support scaffolding system with multiple templates
- `src/promptscribe/scaffolds/default/prompts.yml` - Created minimal scaffold configuration
- `src/promptscribe/scaffolds/example/` and contents - Restructured template files with preserved git history
- `src/promptscribe/scaffolds/dev-kit/prompts.yml` - Created development kit template scaffold
- `src/promptscribe/project_template/` - Removed after migration to scaffolding system

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of a flexible scaffolding system for Prompt Scribe, allowing users to initialize projects with different template configurations. The system addresses the conflict between beginner-friendly and advanced user needs by providing different initialization options.

## Changes Made

### 1. Scaffold Directory Structure
Created a new directory structure in `src/promptscribe/scaffolds/` containing:
- `default/` - minimal configuration for advanced users
- `example/` - full example with complete templates and documentation
- `dev-kit/` - development-focused templates

### 2. CLI Command Enhancement
Updated the `init` command in `cli.py` with:
- A new `--scaffold` option to select template type ('default', 'example', 'dev-kit')
- A `--list-scaffolds` option to display all available templates
- Dynamic discovery of available scaffolds using `importlib.resources`
- Automatic creation of standard directory structure (personas, includes, templates)

### 3. Migration of Template Files
Moved all template files from the flat `project_template/` directory to the new hierarchical structure in `scaffolds/example/`, preserving git history using `git mv` commands:
- `code-reviewer.md` → `scaffolds/example/personas/code-reviewer.md`
- `development-rules.md` → `scaffolds/example/includes/development-rules.md`
- `master.jinja2` → `scaffolds/example/templates/master.jinja2`
- `report.jinja2` → `scaffolds/example/templates/report.jinja2`
- `source-data.json` → `scaffolds/example/includes/source-data.json`
- `prompts.yml` → `scaffolds/example/prompts.yml`

### 4. Minimal Template Configuration
Created a minimal `prompts.yml` for the default scaffold that includes basic configuration without examples, suitable for advanced users who prefer minimal starting points.

### 5. Development Kit Template
Added a `dev-kit` scaffold with a placeholder configuration for development-focused agents and templates.

### 6. Standard Directory Creation
Implemented automatic creation of standard directories (`personas`, `includes`, `templates`) during initialization to ensure consistent project structure regardless of the selected scaffold.

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Flexible Initialization**: Users can choose between minimal and comprehensive starting templates
2. **Scalability**: New scaffolds can be easily added without modifying CLI code
3. **Cleaner Default**: Advanced users get a minimal setup without unnecessary examples
4. **Preserved History**: Git history of template files has been maintained
5. **Dynamic Discovery**: The system automatically detects and lists available scaffolds

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses the requirements outlined in the task. The new scaffolding system provides flexibility for different user types while maintaining backward compatibility and preserving existing git history. The dynamic scaffold discovery ensures that future additions to the scaffolding system require no code changes to the CLI component.
